# SafeStreet-Road Damage Detection and Alert System

## Objective
To develop a AI powered system that detects the road damages and its severity and alerts concerned authorites to take the necessary action.

## Present Existing System
- road maintanance is mostly manual
- we have to inform to the concerned authorities through phone,media..etc
- we have no assurance for the solution
- we cannot tell abot it's severity and cannot give the exact location


## Our Vision
- mobile app to upload the images
- AI model will analyze it's severity
- Auto detection of location and tagging it to the severity page.
- Admin has control to update damage reduction status.
